## Topologically Protected All‚ÄêOptical Memory

**Project description:** Tunable color displays by simply changing the handedness of circularly polarized light has been suggested. Analyzing the higher-order multipole moments in z-shaped silicon nanostructures, we found a group of metasurfaces spanning the entire visible spectrum under left circulary polarized light. These colors become faded under right circularly polarized light.
