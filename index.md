## About me

---
Hi! My name is Seou Choi, and I am a graduate student at Photonics & Modern Electro-Magnetics Group (Research Advisor: Marin Soljačić) in MIT. 

I received my B.S. in Seoul National University.

I have a wide range of interests in both photonics and AI : I belive photonic hardware can provide fast and energy efficient machine learning platform while AI assists our in-depth understanding of photonics.
