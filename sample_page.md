## Topologically Protected All‚ÄêOptical Memory

**Project description:** The separation of processing and storage units in von Neumann architecture has caused an unavoidable memory wall bottleneck in modern computing systems. While the near- or in-memory computation have been suggested in electronic systems to overcome this problem, the realization of an all-optical in-memory processor had not been successful. Here, we propose an all-optical building block for photonic in-memory processors by exploiting dynamically stable states in nonlinear parity-time-symmetric systems.
